## Mission

Solving the **founders problem** — defining venture creation through discovery.

### About Founding
The journey begins when a founder identifies an opportunity to create a venture. Through **discovery**, they explore the market landscape, identify gaps, and define what the venture will do.

### About Funding
Once discovery validates the concept, the venture needs **funding** to bring it to life. This capital provides the runway for execution — paying for development, marketing, and operations.

### About Execution
With funding and a clear direction, the venture **executes** — building the product, hiring the team, and delivering value. The team works toward achieving the mission, creating sustainable growth.

## About

**SuperDAO** — A DAO built on Aragon OSX that solves the venture liquidity problem through zeit tokenization.

The core concept is simple: instead of founders/employees or investors controlling the venture, **control** is distributed through soul-bound zeit tokens. Contributors earn their stake by working, and the venture is managed by those who have proven their commitment.

**ZOON** — The Optimistic Oracle Network that SuperDAO is an instance of. It provides the infrastructure for creating queries (state changes) and actuation markets (who executes work, for how much).
